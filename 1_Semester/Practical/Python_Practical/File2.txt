breathing, looking, seeing, smelling
resting, calmly moving, feeling
sudden, changed, peaceful, & woke
when water falls rush down my two sides
when this earthen back breaks between the crack of two blades
when fire tears through swallows behind tight grins
I see you
Although the world is silent around you
I see you
